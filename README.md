# CPRP

### Project :

This web site was made as final high school degree project. The main purpose is to create interface where students can access and manage machine tool programs without having to use specific software. We used previous students' work as a basis. 

The request was to implement a management functionality for DMU 40, DANOBAT TNC10 machines and measuring tools. We also had to rework the visual appearance of the website.
